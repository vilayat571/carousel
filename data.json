Development of the theatrical film adaptation of It began in March 2009 when Warner Bros. started discussing that they would be bringing it to the big screen, with David Kajganich planned to direct, before being replaced by Cary Fukunaga in June 2012. After being dropped out as the director in May 2015, Andy Muschietti was signed on to direct the film in June 2015. He talks of drawing inspiration from 1980s films such as The Goonies (1985), Stand by Me (1986) and Near Dark (1987). During the development, the film was moved to New Line Cinema division.
